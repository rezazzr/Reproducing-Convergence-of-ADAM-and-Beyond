# Reproducing: On The Convergence of ADAM and Beyond

This is a study based on the paper [On The Convergence of ADAM and Beyond](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ryQu7f-RZ). In this [report](https://github.com/rezazzr/Reproducing-Convergence-of-ADAM-and-Beyond/blob/master/Reproducing_On_The_Convergence_of_ADAM_and_Beyond.pdf) we tried to present a short summery explaining what this paper is about and reproduce the results of the experiments that was shown in the paper.<br>
<br>
There are 3 experiments presented in the paper and the implementation of these experiments can be found in:

1.  Experiment 1, [here](https://github.com/rezazzr/Reproducing-Convergence-of-ADAM-and-Beyond/blob/master/synthetic_case_experiment.ipynb)
2.  Experiment 2 and 3, [here](https://github.com/rezazzr/Reproducing-Convergence-of-ADAM-and-Beyond/blob/master/Logistic_Regression_and_Neural_network_experiment.ipynb)

In addition to these experiment, we also designed an experiment of our own, experiment 4, for which the implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/rezazzr/Reproducing-Convergence-of-ADAM-and-Beyond/blob/master/VAE_exp.ipynb).<br>

* Note: The first section of the report provides a short summery of the paper, the motivation behind its study, and the solution/proposed method to tackle the problem it is addressing. The goal of this section is to target any reader who is seeking to get a general idea of what the paper is about. Hence, this section does not contain any mathematical analysis of the problem. For readers who seek a deeper understanding of the paper and the mathematical concepts related to it, we refer them to the paper itself.
